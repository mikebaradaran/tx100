Aiden did well in this course and I am happy with Aiden's progress.<br />
Aiden made the following comments about the course: I found understanding AWS Step functions highly useful. Especially learning about the different components and how to configure AWS Step Functions. I would say that DynamoDB was less useful as I only really use SQL databases at work<br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />

Sebastian did well in this course and I am happy with Sebastian's progress.<br />
Sebastian made the following comments about the course: The actual topics are nice, and the discussions that was held around the labs were educational. However, I am not too sure of it being so AWS focused. I get that AWS is important, but the labs just make you blindly follow a to-do guide, without ever explaining how anything works or why it works.<br />I think the course would benefit going a little bit more bare-bone for the sake of learning how these things work under the hood, before automating it all with AWS.<br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />

Mark did well in this course and I am happy with Mark's progress.<br />
Mark made the following comments about the course: AWS is such a massive topic it is a bit bewildering, but it was really good to start doing some practical setups using it. I did find that the Labs were a little too focused on following setup instructions rather than explaining what the settings were actually responsible for, I think a broader outline and a simpler explanation of what was being setup would have been useful for most of them.<br />As usual, Mike made the topics enjoyable and engaging and left me wanting to learn more independently.<br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />

Benjamin did well in this course and I am happy with Benjamin's progress.<br />
Benjamin made the following comments about the course: API Gateway - this felt closest to what I'd see in my day-to-day<br />
DynamioDb seemed like an interesting NoSQL database solution. My initial impression of it is it's more friendly then MongoDB (although I'm still not convinced why you'd not just use MySQL or SQLite).

Less useful - Pretty much everything else AWS to be honest. The course was too short to really make any of it memorable. My Employer uses Azure so I have no chance of applying it<br /><br />Punctuality & Engagement:<br />
